# Pokemon-Fire-Red-Battle-Simulator
This is a repository of the code and its documentation for Group 7's final project for the Complex Digital Systems Deign course taught by Dr. David Calhoun at Rowan University.

The group cosisted of Carmen DiGironimo, Christopher Lentini, Casey Robinson, and Alison Silvestri.

The goal of the project was to create a battle simulator based off of the Pokemon Fire Red video game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, originally released for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.

In this repository, you will find all of the necessary files to recreate the program.
The program was run on a DE10-Standard FPGA development board from Terasic.  An SD card, an Ethernet Cable, a VGA cable, and a VGA compatable moitor were also used in this project.
